# Intro to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to build scalable network applications.

## Why Learn Node.js?

- **Efficiency**: Node.js uses non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in data-intensive real-time applications.
- **Full Stack JavaScript**: Allows developers to write both the client-side and server-side code in JavaScript.
- **Community**: A large and active community with a vast selection of free tools and modules available through the npm registry.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: All APIs of the Node.js library are asynchronous.
- **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable**: Uses event looping, which helps servers respond in a non-blocking way.
- **No Buffering**: Outputs data in chunks, not buffering it.

Node.js is essential for developers looking to create fast, scalable network applications that can handle numerous simultaneous connections with high throughput.
