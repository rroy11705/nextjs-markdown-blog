# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Introduced in React 16.8, they have revolutionized how developers write components and manage state in React applications.

## Why Use React Hooks?

- **Simplicity**: Hooks simplify your code, making it easier to use state and other React features in functional components.
- **Reusability**: Custom hooks allow you to create reusable stateful logic that can be shared across components.
- **Organization**: Related code is grouped together which makes it more manageable and easier to follow.

## Core Hooks

- **useState**: Lets you add state to functional components.
- **useEffect**: Performs side effects in function components.
- **useContext**: Shares values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

React Hooks offer a powerful and elegant way to build components. By understanding and utilizing Hooks, you can significantly streamline your React development process.
